## Agenda

This meeting we've invited some of the people working to integrate Rust into the Linux kernel to come and speak. We've asked them to give us a feel for how the integration works and help identify those places where the experience is rough. The expectation is that we can use this feedback as an input when deciding what work to pursue and what features to prioritize for stabilization.

- (5 min) Opening remarks 👋 ([nikomatsakis])
- (40 min) Rust in Linux ([ojeda])
- (5 min) Closing ([nikomatsakis])

## Social hour

Like always, we'll be running a social hour after the CTCFT. The idea is really
simple: for the hour after the meeting, we will create breakout rooms in Zoom
with different themes. You can join any breakout room you like and hangout.
