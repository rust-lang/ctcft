## Agenda

This meeting we've invited some of the people working to integrate Rust into the
Linux kernel to come and speak. We've asked them to give us a feel for how the
integration works and help identify those places where the experience is rough.
The expectation is that we can use this feedback as an input when deciding what
work to pursue and what features to prioritize for stabilization.

- (5 min) Opening remarks 👋 ([nikomatsakis])
- (40 min) Rust for Linux ([ojeda], [alex], [wedsonaf]) [slides]
  - The Rust for Linux project is adding Rust support to the Linux kernel. While
    it is still the early days, there are some areas of the Rust language,
    library, and tooling where the Rust project might be able to help out - for
    instance, via stabilization of features, suggesting ways to tackle
    particular problems, and more. This talk will walk through the issues found,
    along with examples where applicable.
- (5 min) Closing ([nikomatsakis])

## Social hour

Like always, we'll be running a social hour after the CTCFT. The idea is really
simple: for the hour after the meeting, we will create breakout rooms in Zoom
with different themes. You can join any breakout room you like and hangout.
